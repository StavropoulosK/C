# C

This C project implements a text analyzer that processes an input text file and a dictionary file (both in .txt format). The program offers functionality to identify words in the input text that are not found in the dictionary, giving users the option to either replace them or add them to the dictionary. It also computes statistics on the input text, such as the number of unique words. To ensure that any modifications are saved, the program must be exited through the designated command option (option 0), rather than being closed abruptly. The project is written in ANSI C and is implemented in three different ways: (a) using a static array where both input and dictionary files are loaded into fixed-size arrays, (b) using dynamic arrays that adjust in size as needed, and (c) using linked lists, where each word from the input text and dictionary is represented as a node. For the static array version, large input files may require increasing the program's stack size to avoid crashes (e.g., gcc main.c -o main.exe "-Wl,--stack=8388608" ./main). Each implementation is contained in its own folder, which includes the corresponding main.c file along with example input files such as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and a dictionary of English words.
