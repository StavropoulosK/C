# C

This is a C project to create a text analyzer. You enter an input text file and a dictionary file (both .txt) and you have the following options: to find all the words in the input text that are not in the dictionary and to replace them or add them in the dictionary. Also the program calculates statistics for your input text, such as the different word it contains. For the changes to take place, you need to exit program via the command options (option 0) and not abruptly closing the program. This is a program written in ansi C with three different ways, a) static array, the whole input and dictionary files are loaded in matrix with static size, b)dynamic array, the input and dictionary files are loaded in matrix which have size that changes dynamically, c)linked list, where each word on the input text and the dictionary is a node. In the first option, if the files are very big, you might need to increase the stack size of the program, otherwise it may crash ( i.e. gcc main.c -o main.exe "-Wl,--stack=8388608" ./main). Each folder contains the main.c code for each respective case, along with an example input text (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) and a dictionary of english words.
